# tic-tac-toe
This is a tic-tac-toe game, programmed in Ruby. Made to demonstrate my OOP-based skills.

# Project Description
This application allows you to play against the computer in a game of tic-tac-toe. You can choose whether you want to be (O) or (X), and the computer will pick the other.

The computer randomly selects positions on the board. You can also pit two robots against each other, both of which will place their tiles randomly.

# The Challenges
I faced many challenges throughout the creation of this program. First, I had to understand what good object-oriented programming practices looked like in action. Instead of just reading up on it, but actually implementing it. It was difficult at first to understand what to group together and hwat to keep seperate, which parts should make a class, and how the classes should interact. However, after hours of research and coding, I managed to write intelligible code, that's easy to read and understand. 

# How to Use
There is no install, just take the code and run it in any ruby compiler.
