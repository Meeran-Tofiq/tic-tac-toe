# tic-tac-toe
This is a tic-tac-toe game, programmed in Ruby. Made to demonstrate my OOP-based skills.

# Project Description
This application allows you to play against the computer in a game of tic-tac-toe. You can choose whether you want to be (O) or (X), and the computer will pick the other.

The computer randomly selects positions on the board. You can also pit two robots against each other, both of which will place their tiles randomly.

## The Challenges

# How to Use
There is no install, just take the code and run it in any ruby compiler.
